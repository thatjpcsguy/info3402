## Budget Information

$250,000 in seed capital has been raised for the completion of this project. It will be difficult to procure additional funds as this will involve investors and fundraising. The majority of the cost will be in developer salaries and user acquisition. Ideally, the project will be generating additional revenue after the MVP (minimum viable product) has been completed but this has not been factored in at this stage.

## Project Objectives
Wydgytz is an idea that has been validated and in prototype development for the past year. The initially small team has recently secured some seed capital and is now looking to build their product. The objective for this project is to complete an MVP of the product and launch to a small number of beta users in 5 months. Then, continue to develop the product and develop a user acquisition strategy and launch to the public within 12 months.

## Key Schedule Milestones
* Completed the MVP of the product and begin beta testing by 1st of August 2014.
* Launched to the public by 1st of April 2015.

## Approach
* Purchase hardware (laptops, monitors, etc.) for all staff within a week.
* Utilising a SCRUM methodology with 2 sprints per month for agile approach to product development.
* Daily stand up meetings over email using as tool such as [iDoneThis](https://idonethis.com) to maximise communication and minimise lengthy stand ups.
* End of sprint retrospective/planning meetings with all staff involved.
* Use a tool such as [Trello](https://trello.com) to organise and prioritise tasks.
* Conduct thorough and consistent beta testing through the entire development process to continually validate idea and implementation.
